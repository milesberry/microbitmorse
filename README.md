# Morse code text entry for the BBC micro:bit

More a proof of concept than anything, but here's one approach to entering text onto a [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk/) using nothing more than [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code).

Key in Morse using button A. To get the text displayed, hold button A and tap B.

At the moment, this only does one word at a time, and the timings are set very slow, as I'm not particulary good at Morse code! There's plenty of scope for improvement...

The was inspired by, and borrows code from the [Raspberry Pi Morse code worksheet](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/morse-code-virtual-radio/worksheet/)
It was built using [ntoll](https://github.com/ntoll)'s [Mu editor](https://github.com/ntoll/mu) for [BBC micro:bit micropython](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
